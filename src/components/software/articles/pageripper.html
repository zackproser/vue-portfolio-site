I wanted to create an app with a Golang backend that also served its own react UI.

Golang is an excellent choice because of its speed and its [powerful HTML parsing package](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html)

## Overview

Enter a URL and hit enter and the app fetches the page, instantly extracts all links therein, and does some light analysis on the links to determine the ranking of domains that the page links out to.

You can then download all the links in CSV format with a single button click.

## Technical details and takeaways

Go's channels are ideal for extracting links, doing analysis on them and signaling that the overall processing job is complete.
