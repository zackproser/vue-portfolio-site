## Intro

Page Gobbler was my first foray into Objective-C and the Xcode IDE. I was determined to learn enough to build a quality app worthy of acceptance into the official Apple App Store.

Page Gobbler is no longer available in the Mac App Store, because, despite making regular sales, the payouts were not worth the hassle of dealing with Apple.

All the same, I had a lot of fun drawing the Gobbler in Photoshop.

## Technical Details & Takeaways

Building Page Gobbler was an immensely satisfying experience. Despite multiple challenges, almost entirely with the App Store approval process and my proposed app names, I finally managed to get a stable and polished app into the Store for sale despite having never been exposed to Objective-C before.

The idea for Page Gobbler occurred to me while I was working at [BrightContext](https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/16/brightcontext-acquired-by-wealthengine-to-bring-big-data-to-marketers/) since we often needed to extract large lists of Twitter Usernames to feed into our Big Data Processing system for further analysis.

Working with XCode was new and different. It had its frustrations and I found it to be an exceptionally opinionated piece of software, but ultimately I became comfortable enough with it to complete the production of Page Gobbler. It was thrilling to make the transition from web development to native development on the mac. When I finally had Page Gobbler stable and working well with all the kinks ironed out I felt immense satisfaction.

Working on Page Gobbler caused me to pay close attention to the very small but essential details that all work together to create the experience of a polished and solid app versus a hastily thrown together app. Minor things like terminating the entire program when a user clicks the red X to building Cocoa's Drag & Drop API into the app for ease of use work together to make Page Gobbler dead-simple and fun to use.

Once I got Page Gobbler into the App Store I built a node-powered marketing site to provide a quick demo of the app's functionality and to help drive sales and rank higher for related terms to increase sales.
