[WealthEngine's API](http://dev.wealthengine.com) allows you to look up anyone's wealth in realtime.

I decided to write an SDK around WealthEngine's RESTful API that handles validation of parameters before making API calls. As a developer, all you need to do is clone the SDK into your project and instantiate the WeAPI object with your ApiKey.

## Key Features

* * *

*   Allows you to specify your desired API environment when instantiating the class
*   Validates parameter objects before making API calls
*   Returns errors, status code and response body

## Technical Details & Takeaways

WealthEngine did not have a Python SDK available at the time, so I just wrote my own and decided to share it.

You can find a link to it on [the official WealthEngine documentation page](http://dev.wealthengine.com/api), under the SDK's section.
