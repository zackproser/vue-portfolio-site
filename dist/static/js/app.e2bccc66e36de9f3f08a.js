Making my first game means coming full circle to when I first started playing video games at age 3.\n\nMy intent with CanyonRunner was to build a simple, solid HTML5 game that works on desktop and mobile, features a story and all the basic game systems you'd expect such as a progress saving system, top scores, different game dynamics on each level and two different endings.\n\nIncluding the time spent learning the new framework, building CanyonRunner took me exactly 76 days of a few spare working hours here and there each day.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n**_Intense Aerial Dogfights.

It was fun learning about the basic physics patterns behind 2D side-scrollers.\n\nUltimately, I learned the most about compressing and packaging assets correctly for fast delivery to mobile devices. I used a single spritesheet and a single audiosprite to drastically reduce the number of http requests required to load the game on a mobile device.\n\nWe all know it's annoying to be in the middle of a game and lose your progress because something comes up. I was able to take advantage of localStorage to create player-specific objects that are written to at various points throughout the game.\n\nThis system also allows for the final determination of which ending a player will receive. When the final level is successfully completed, the game inspects the player object and determines how long it took the player to complete the game. Depending upon this total time calculation, they are shown one of two possible \"Game States\".\n\nRegardless of which ending they get, the player has a chance to share their gaming experience on Twitter - via a built-in button that autopopulates a Tweet for them and includes a link back to the hosting site - helping to drive more social traffic for myself and my sponsors."},"22LL":function(e,t){e.exports="\n[![article-optimize-com](/static/assets/img/optimizer-screens/symfony-optimizer-splash.png)](https://www.article-optimize.com)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis post will walk through my open-sourced Article Optimizer app, taking a look at some of its key architectural decisions and features. This app is running at [www.article-optimize.com](//www.article-optimize.com) if you’d like to try it out. I’ve also open-sourced it, so you can follow along in [the Github repo here](//www.github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer).\n\n## What is the Article Optimizer?\n\n### Background\n\nThis is a web application built in PHP 7 leveraging the [Symfony web framework](//symfony.com). Its intended user base is content writers, especially those whose content will ultimately live online. At the end of the day, a complex interplay between human signals, such as comments and social shares, and search engine ranking systems will ultimately determine how “successful” a given piece of content is, from a rankings perspective at least. This tool was developed to assist authors in understanding how their content is likely to be parsed and ranked by search engines.\n\n### How it works\n\nYou can [submit an article on any topic through the tool](//www.article-optimize.com) and in around 1 second you’ll be presented with a detailed analysis of your work, breaking down its:\n\n*   rough word count\n*   content category (Food & Drink, Politics, Hobbies etc)\n*   sentiment analysis of major concepts, keywords, entities (positive, negative, neutral)\n*   keyword / phrase density\n\nIn addition, the tool will do its best to find copyright-free images that are on-topic. If you write an article about growing tomatoes at home, the tool will try to find you a good handful of high quality tomato images that you are free to include and publish in your article. Including on-topic high quality media in your content ultimately leads to a better reading experience on the web and can improve your article’s search rankings.\n\nFinally, the report generated by the tool contains a reference to your full article and is written to a unique URL that can be easily shared via the programmatically generated Bitly link, the social share buttons, or by using a built-in feature that allows you to send the report by email to a friend, colleague or client. This aspect is intended to empower authors to show off the quality of their work as validated by a third party service.\n\nHere's an example report:\n\n![article-optimizer-report](/static/assets/img/optimizer-screens/article-optimizer-example-report.png)\n\n### Why use it\n\nThis tool is intended to be used as a “spot check” for authors when they are getting close to wrapping up their article or are getting ready to publish it. They may not be aware, for example, that they are unintentionally “keyword stuffing” their article by repeating a given phrase with unnatural frequency, or that their portrayal of a given person is coming across as negative.\n\n## Main Technical Considerations\n\n### How much work has to be done and how long can I put it off for?\n\nIn creating this tool, one of my primary concerns was speed. Specifically, the time between the moment an author submits their article for processing and the moment at which they can view the completed analysis of their work should be as short as possible.\n\nA general rule of thumb is that users of web applications begin to perceive the app they’re interacting with as sluggish or non-responsive if there’s anything more than a second of latency between the time they initiate an action through the user interface and the time they receive the next visual feedback from the app. For a more in-depth article on this sense of responsiveness from a user experience perspective, check out [this article](//www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/).\n\nThe Article Optimizer renders reports for most articles in 1 second or less. This performance is the result of careful planning and thinking through what processing has to happen before the report can be rendered, and what functionality can be offloaded until afterwards.\n\n### Identifying the bare minimum you can do before rendering\n\nIn the case of this application, I’m using [IBM Watson’s](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) [AlchemyLanguage API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/alchemy-language.html) to do most of the heavy lifting in terms of linguistic processing. Since this means I have to do at least one network request to an external service following a user submission and before rendering the report, I wasn’t willing to call any others during processing. Everything else (Bitly, Flickr) would have to be done via ajax after the initial report was rendered.\n\nThat’s why the bulk of the processing is done so quickly and why the tool feels snappy and quick to use. When a user submits an article, I do validation of the content both on the client and on the server. If there are any show stopping issues, such as if the user submitted bogus content that’s too short, they’ll get a helpful and descriptive error message up front and everything grinds to a halt until they fix their submission.\n\nAssuming the user submits a valid-looking article of sufficient length, I sanitize and filter it to remove any crap, remnant HTML tags from a hurried copy and paste operation, or malicious embedded scripts because we never trust user input. Only then do I hand off the article to AlchemyLanguage for a detailed breakdown. Once I receive the response, I do a minimum of report preparation work: examining the AlchemyLanguage response, bundling the key information into a sane format as expected by the report templates. Once this is done, I can render the permanent report, write its contents to a static HTML file that will live in perpetuity for the user to share, and redirect the user to this completed report.\n\nIt’s important to step back at this point to understand: at this time the user’s article has been fully processed, their report written to the server, and the user is actually looking at the report and beginning to read it, but none of these things have happened yet:\n\n1.  The Bitly short link for this specific report has not been generated or displayed\n2.  The Twitter share button has not had its contents altered by jQuery to include this Bitly link\n3.  None of the copyright-free images have even been searched for yet\n\nThe user doesn’t notice these things because it will take several more seconds, at the earliest, before they begin to need any of this information. As soon as the report page is finished loading, jQuery handlers go to work fetching and updating all of this data via the help of server-side controllers designated for each task and associated service. The point is that most of the time the user will never notice the brief delay, because they need to scroll through a whole lot of report details before getting to the images section at the bottom. All the average user knows is that the tool they’re using processes articles very quickly.\n\n### Keeping it clean and easily extendable\n\nPart of the reason I chose the [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com) for this rewrite is that Symfony does a good job of enforcing some sanity and organization around web projects without being so dogmatic that you can’t customize things to your liking.\n\nIn case I decided to return to this application after 2 years to add some new features, I know my future self would want to open a project that is clean, well-organized, thoroughly documented and demonstrating good separation of concerns. This means lots of DocBlocks throughout the application, giving other developers everything they need to know about a given class or method up front.\n\nStarting with the PHP side of things, the project begins with [the Default controller](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php). This defines handlers for the main routes of the application, and the behavior of the index page and its 3 forms. One of Symfony’s main strengths is the significant work they have put into forms and form processing, which allowed me to define rich form functionality in less code, keeping the Default controller reasonably slim.\n\nOnce we have a valid submission, work flows to [the Analyzer class](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/Analyzer.php), which is concerned with breaking down and processing the article text, interacting with the AlchemyLanguage API, and bundling the final analysis into a format expected by [the report templates](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/app/Resources/views/default/report.html.twig).\n\n### Keeping it easy to reason about\n\nLoosely following the idea that a literate program should read like a short story, I think of the steps described in [the Analyzer class](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/Analyzer.php) as a recipe for processing a user’s article in a generic way that will result in useful insight. My thinking here is that if one or more other programmers were to begin working on this project, they should be able to easily read the Analyzer class to quickly gain an understanding of the general processing steps that occur for each article.\n\n### Separation of concerns\n\nAt the same time, I want to maintain a balance between legibility and concision. That’s why the nitty gritty details of lower level actions are abstracted away by the higher level Analyzer class, but detailed in [the AnalysisHelper class](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/AnalysisHelper.php). Furthermore, curl calls are abstracted into a [Curl Helper class](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/CurlHelper.php), just as [Flickr](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/Flickr.php) and [Bitly](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Classes/Bitly.php) calls are abstracted into their own classes which use the Curl helper class. The main idea is to build reusable components and then load them wherever leveraging them makes sense.\n\nWe don’t want to configure and execute raw curl calls in every method that makes a network request, because it’s not as easily maintainable and will also result in a lot of duplicated code. If we wind up needing to change a header across all of our curl calls, we’d need to find every instance of a raw curl call to change it - or we may miss some and be left with inconsistent behavior.\n\n### Leverage the framework\n\nSymfony also features the [twig templating language](//symfony.com/doc/current/templating.html), and it’s excellent. Though in general we want to keep as much logic out of our templates as possible, many of the built in-functions (such as count) are useful for determining if we have enough data to render a full section, or if we should display an error instead.\n\n### Even in templates, we want to build reusable components\n\nAfter getting everything working and displaying the way I wanted it, I started looking for duplicated code in my templates. The ribbons that introduce each new report section, for example, are all roughly the same - though their overlaid text changes. This makes them a good candidate for refactoring: moving the code that generates a ribbon into a custom twig function “ribbon” that we can call with a single string argument for the text that should appear on the ribbon.\n\nTwig lets you create [an AppExtension class](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/src/AppBundle/Twig/AppExtension.php) that defines your custom twig functions. In addition to cutting down on duplicate code and helping you to keep your templates clean, leveraging custom twig functions is also a great way to ensure your team members can call the same functions when building out features, helping you maintain style uniformity throughout your application.\n\n### Client-side Javascript\n\nI chose tried and true jQuery for the client side javascript for a few reasons:\n\n*   In general, this app is not complex or javascript heavy enough to warrant the overhead of a full frontend framework\n*   There are no server side models that need to be updated in realtime / synced to the client, so data binding is not a concern\n*   The bulk of this app lives on the server. The client side javascript is only tasked with handling a few modals, making some ajax calls, and doing some light validation on user input\n\nHowever, just because we’re not using a the latest framework hotness doesn’t mean we should be writing disorganized spaghetti scripts. I wanted a good way to organize the jQuery selectors that my javascript would be using, without falling victim to the all to common gotchas of changing DOM selectors over the course of project development causing errors.\n\nI found a good approach in a Stackoverflow response that boils down to defining your jQuery selectors in [one file or object](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/web/js/index.js), and then passing that “controls” object into the actual client module. This accomplishes a couple of things:\n\nIt keeps our jQuery selectors defined in a single place. Though [the client](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/web/js/optimizer-client.js) itself might use and manipulate a given selector a number of times in various complex functions, there’s only one place to update its selector if your DOM changes When your module is agnostic about the selectors of the given elements its operating on, its easier to write portable code - keeping things abstract makes it easier to publish the module as a library, jQuery plugin, etc Our final code is cleaner and simpler. We don’t have a confusing mixture of selectors and objects polluting our module.\n\nIn addition to this handy trick, I employed [the Revealing Module pattern](//addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript) via a [closure](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) to define a “client” object that exposes only a single method, init, to the on-page javascript that instantiates it.\n\nI do this because I want the module’s state to remain private, such that users can’t tamper with it and so that there is no chance for collisions between module variables and variables in the global scope. This is a handy pattern for developing javascript plugins that might need to run in the same memory space as a dozen other libraries, while avoiding the pitfalls that come from polluting global scope.\n\n### Building configurable knobs for ease of use\n\nThings that you expect to happen often for your application should be easy. For example, this application has two separate advertisement modules, each containing 2 ad blocks, that can enabled or disabled. If this application were running on behalf of a company, you could imagine that the marketing department would have a keen interest in swapping out the ads every time there was a new promotion or campaign running.\n\nWe don't want to deal with a complex, tedious or error-prone manual process each time we update this section, then. Therefore, we should make advertisements configurable and do the work of implementing our business logic in the controllers for displaying ads up front, before we launch. To demonstrate this approach I defined an advertisements blog in [the example-parameters.yml file here](//github.com/zackproser/articleoptimizer/blob/github/app/config/example-parameters.yml#L123).\n\nNow when marketing opens a ticket for 4 new campaigns, you're just modifying the values in a config file, instead of wrangling a bunch of custom assets and HTML by hand.\n\n### Building configurable knobs for your friends in DevOps\n\nThis same principle applies across any aspects of your app that you expect would need to change for any reason in the future, foreseeable or otherwise. Maybe operations needs to consolidate vendor accounts under a single new corporate credit card, which means the API keys your app depends on need to change. Would you rather have to tell Ops that you need a day or so to grep through every instance of the key and change it by hand? Or that they can simply change an environment variable, clear the production cache and restart Apache?\n\nAnything that could change or will need to change should probably be a configurable knob: an evironment variable or parameter that someone who is not necessarily a developer with deep expertise in the given application can look up in the project documentation and modify with a high degree of confidence they won't break anything by doing so.\n\n### Thanks for reading\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to [email me](mailto:zackproser@gmail.com).

This approach allowed me to bring my hosting costs down to $35 per month by running 7 apps, 3 written in PHP and 4 in Node.js, on 2 DigitalOcean virtual machines, provisioned and maintained by Laravel Forge, and protected and cached by Cloudflare.\n\nThis tutorial will cover:\n\n*   using Laravel Forge and deployment scripts to achieve reproducible builds\n*   obtaining free SSL certificates with Let’s Encrypt\n*   using PM2 to daemonize your node.js applications and automatically restart them\n*   configuring nginx to proxy requests to your node backend\n*   configuring Cloudflare’s free tier to serve as your DNS, web proxy, and CDN for a free performance boost and analytics\n*   configuring StatusCake for free uptime monitoring and alerts\n\nThe end result is a streamlined app portfolio, push-button deployments of new changes, and a stack that can handle hundreds of thousands of requests per month, all for $35 in monthly hosting fees.\n\n## Getting set up with Laravel Forge\n\nLaravel Forge is a service that will spin up, configure and manage servers for you. You can connect Forge with your DigitalOcean account, and it will provision servers for you via DigitalOcean’s API. You can also use a custom VPS as your deployment target if you’d prefer that.\n\nLaravel Forge is specifically designed for the deployment and management of PHP servers to run apps built with the Laravel and Symfony web frameworks, but I’ll show you how easy it is to also deploy a node.js application using Forge.\n\nForge also knows how to connect to your git repository, and you can specify which branch you want Forge to watch when you’re configuring a new site. This means that, once you’ve configured an app, you have a reproducible deployment process.\n\nLaravel forge is $15 per month, but for that subscription fee you get unlimited deployments, and you can even configure your apps for git push deployments using a feature called Quick Deployment. If you enable Quick Deployment, Forge will listen for your repo’s git commit hooks, meaning that all you need to do is push to your master branch and Forge will take care of deploying your latest code to your server automatically.\n\n![laravel-forge-enable-quick-deployment](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/enable-quick-deployment.png)\n\nForge is a great solution if you don’t want to lose any time to provisioning and configuring servers (doing installs, adding ssh keys, etc) but instead want to focus on building apps.\n\nYou can sign up for Laravel Forge [here.](https://forge.laravel.com/auth/register)\n\n## Create and add your ssh key\n\nYou can give Forge an ssh key, which it will automatically install on every server it provisions for you.\n\nLet’s first create a new ssh key for this purpose - be sure to update this command with your actual email address:\n\n    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “your-email@example.com"\n\nI like to name my key after its purpose - but you can name it whatever you want:\n\n    Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): laravel-forge\n\nIf you’re on a mac you can easily copy the contents of your public key in order to add it to Forge via the UI:\n\n    $ cat ~/.ssh/laravel-forge.pub | pbcopy\n\nNow navigate to My Account (The drop down menu at top right in the Forge UI) -> SSH Keys and you can save your key to your account:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/add-key.png)\n\n## Create your first droplet\n\nLaravel Forge integrates with DigitalOcean out of the box, and uses DigitalOcean’s REST API to provision droplets on your behalf. A droplet is a virtual machine that we can use as a host for our applications.\n\nThe $10/mo droplet is beefy enough to host a handful of smaller apps or websites and it has the following specs:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/create-droplet.png)\n\n*   1GB of memory\n*   1 core processor\n*   30GB SSD Disk\n*   2TB of network transfer\n\nIf you want, you can enable weekly backups for your droplet while you’re creating it - just note this will slightly increase your monthly fee.\n\nOnce Forge provisions a droplet for you, it creates a ‘forge’ user on that VM. This user will own the source files, nginx configurations, etc.\n\nNow that we have our droplet provisioned, let’s test it to ensure everything is working properly by ssh’ing into our machine.\n\n    $ ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/laravel-forge forge@192.242.231.340\n\nLet’s now add an entry to our ssh config so that we can easily obtain shell access in the future:\n\n    Host Node3\n      User forge\n      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/laravel-forge\n      HostName 192.242.231.340\n\nAnd finally let’s test our new config entry:\n\n    $ ssh Node3\n\nMost of the time we’ll want to allow Forge to administer the server for us, but sometimes you may want to ssh into your server all the same.\n\n## Create your new site\n\nNow that we have our droplet provisioned and tested and saved as a host in our ssh config, it’s time to add our first site. When we add a site via the Forge UI, a new directory for our source code, as well as a new nginx configuration that maps requests for our new host to this root, will be configured for us automatically.\n\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, I’ll use my portfolio site which is a node.js application written with the Express framework. We can leave the Project Type set to General PHP / Laravel:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/create-site.png)\n\nMeanwhile, we’ll provide Forge with the fully qualified URL to our git repository so that it can pull down our latest source code during a deployment:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/add-repository.png)\n\n## Use PM2 to manage your node.js app\n\nPM2 is a very powerful and feature-rich process manager for node.js applications. One of the ways you can configure it to manage your application is to provide a pm2-config.json file in the root of your project, which contains a configuration object describing your application to PM2.\n\nLet’s create a pm2-config.json file in the root of our project:\n\n    {\n      "apps" : [{\n        // Portfolio Application\n        "name"        : "Zackproser.com Portfolio App",\n        "script"      : "app.js",\n        "args"        : [],\n       "node_args"   : "",\n        "merge_logs"  : true,\n        "cwd"         : "/home/forge/zackproser.com/",\n        "env": {\n          "PORT": "3000"\n        },\n        "env_production" : {\n           "NODE_ENV": "production",\n           "PORT": "3000"\n        }\n      }]\n    }\n\nThis configuration gives our node application a name, which we’ll be able to use later to start and stop our process, defines the entry point as app.js, and allows us to specify which port we want our application to listen on.\n\nPM2 can do a lot, and you can find its complete documentation here. For our purposes, we just need PM2 to start and stop our node applications during deployments, and to monitor them and automatically restart them if they should die for any reason.\n\nNow that we have our pm2-config.json file in the root of our project, we can ssh into our DigitalOcean vm and globally install pm2, so that it can be used to managed all of our node apps:\n\n    $ npm i -g pm2@latest\n\n## Configure your deployment script\n\nOne of the best features of Laravel Forge is the ability to define a custom deployment script. Use these to run any commands you want - Forge will execute it every time it deploys a new version of your application.\n\nLets take a look at a deployment script for our node.js express app, now that we can use PM2 to start and stop our application:\n\n    cd /home/forge/zackproser.com\n    #Pull down latest code\n    git pull origin master\n    #Install all node dependencies\n    npm i\n    #Stop and kill previous instance of this application\n    pm2 stop "Zackproser.com Portfolio App"\n    #Daemonize portfolio application\n    pm2 start pm2-config.json\n\nIn this example, we pull the latest code from our project’s master branch, install any node modules, stop any previous instance of the PM2 managed application, which we can do by name since we defined one in our pm2-config.json. This is a handy way to have PM2 manage several different node apps simultaneously. We can even ask pm2 for an easy to read status report:\n\n    $pm2 status\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/pm2-status.png)\n\n## Proxy requests to your node.js backend\n\nWhen Forge created our site, it automatically created an nginx config for us as well, loaded it onto our server and reloaded the nginx service so our changes would go live.\n\nForge was primarily designed to deploy PHP apps, but it’s simple enough to get a node application running behind nginx. We just need to take advantage of nginx’s excellent built-in proxy capabilities.\n\nTo modify your site’s nginx configuration, while viewing your site page in the Forge UI, scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the Edit Files button - click that and then the Edit Nginx Configuration link that will appear.\n\nYou’ll notice that Forge has built the nginx configuration from a template, based partially on our configuration values for this site. You definitely want to leave all of the includes that forge adds before and after the server block - else you risk making your site inoperable.\n\nThe section that we’re interested in is the location block that begins with /. For a standard PHP or Laravel site, the default setting of try_files works well. In our case, we’re running a node.js process that’s bound to a specific port on our virtual machine, so we need to tell nginx that, for this particular site, inbound requests should be proxied to the node process running our application:\n\n     location / {\n            proxy_pass http://192.241.231.340:3000;\n            proxy_http_version 1.1;\n            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n            proxy_set_header Connection \'upgrade\';\n            proxy_set_header Host $host;\n            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n        }\n\nNginx will now pass incoming requests for this hostname to our Express application and return the response it generates to the requesting client.\n\n## Test your deployment process\n\nWe’ve got everything configured now. It’s time to ensure everything is working properly by making a small change to our app and letting Forge execute a deployment.\n\nIf you have QuickDeploy enabled, make a small change of some kind (perhaps adding a new html meta tag in your header), commit your change and then:\n\n    $ git push origin master\n\nIf you don’t have QuickDeploy enabled, you can commit your code, push your changes up to your origin repository and then click the Deploy Now button on your site’s page in the Forge UI.\n\n## Obtain your SSL cert with Let’s Encrypt\n\nWe should always strive to deliver our web content over SSL, in order to provide our users with a more secure experience. Buying and maintaining certificates for each new site or app used to be expensive, but thankfully today we have [Let’s Encrypt.](https://letsencrypt.org/)\n\nLet’s Encrypt is a certificate authority that provides SSL certificates for free. They do this in order to lower the barrier to entry for people to obtain certificates, and therefore foster more widespread adoption of SSL. Even better, Laravel Forge automates obtaining, configuring, and renewing Let’s Encrypt certificates for us.\n\nAll you need in order to make this happen is a registered domain name that you control, which should match your site name in Forge.\n\nIn the Site Details menu on the left hand sidebar, click SSL. Next, click LetsEncrypt. This next part is important. Before you click Obtain Certificate, ensure that you provide both your domain name without www, followed by a comma, followed by your domain name with www, as shown in this screenshot:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/obtain-certificate.png)\n\nWhen you click Obtain Certificate, Forge will take your domains string and post it back to a service that calls Let’s Encrypt’s API. You need to tell Let’s Encrypt which domains the resulting certificate should be valid for. You should request both versions of your domain (www. and naked) - otherwise some of your users may see certificate errors, security warnings, or be unable to access your site at all.\n\nOnce your certificate is obtained, it will show up below the form with a status: Installed, but not yet Active. Click the link to activate your certificate - which will modify your site’s nginx config to configure and turn on SSL termination using your new certificate. Once that step completes, test out your site by visiting:\n\n    https://<your-domain-name>\n\nYou should see a green lock icon in the top left of your browser’s address bar - with no warning or exclamation point icons. If there are issues, open your browser’s developer tools to view any errors in the console.\n\nOne of the most common culprits will be mixed content warnings - which occur if you’re trying to load assets (such as Javascript libraries or SDKs, images, advertisements, animations, etc) over http - even though your site is configured to use SSL. This is a security issue that browsers will complain about. If you see mixed content warnings in your console, you will need to update your application to request those assets over https. You can (change the links from http:// to https://).\n\nYou can find more resources for dealing with this common issue [here.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170476-How-do-I-fix-the-SSL-Mixed-Content-Error-Message-)\n\n## Use Google PageSpeed to test your site\n\nGoogle built [a tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) for testing how performant your site is - and how the overall site performs on both mobile and desktop form factors.\n\nLet\'s take a look at how our site is measuring up now that we have our app deployed and securely delivered over SSL by going to Google\'s pagespeed tool and submitting the URL to our site:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/unminified-fails.png)\n\nNot bad, but we can also use Cloudflare’s free plan for a big performance boost.\n\n## Configure Cloudflare’s Free Plan\n\n[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) will:\n\n*   Handle our DNS resolution\n*   Cache our application and distribute it to the edge (a global network of over 117 data centers at the time of this writing) so that our users get the best possible experience\n*   Provide us with detailed analytics\n\n## Create a Cloudflare account and configure your DNS records\n\nNow that our site is up and running and we have automated deployments in place, we can leverage Cloudflare for several benefits out of the box:\n\nCaching and global distribution of our content (so that users get our page from a server that’s close to them geographically)\n\n*   DDoS protection\n*   Speedy DNS resolution\n*   Web traffic analytics\n\nIt usually takes about 5 minutes or less to get up and running with Cloudflare, and the performance boost your site may experience is often significant.\n\nFollow [this guide](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Step-2-Create-a-Cloudflare-account-and-add-a-website) to quickly configure the free Cloudflare plan and point it at your site.\n\n## Configure Full SSL\n\nSince we took the time to configure HTTPS for our site, we can take advantage of the Full SSL setting in our Cloudflare account.\n\nThe benefit of full SSL is that the connection from our web server (our droplet) to Cloudflare, is encrypted, as is the connection from Cloudflare to our end users consuming our content.\n\nNow that our site is stood up, securely delivering content over SSL and protected and accelerated by Cloudflare, let’s see how we’re doing in terms of overall site health, load time, page weight - all of which will factor into how well our site will perform in search results:\n\n![](/static/assets/img/do-laravel-cloudflare-screens/insight-improvements.png)\n\nWe can see that Cloudflare has already given us a lot of the caching and minification best practices for free.\n\n## Set up StatusCake for free monitoring\n\nNow that we have our app configured and deployed, lets set up free monitoring with [StatusCake.](https://www.statuscake.com/) StatusCake will send us an email if any of our monitored sites go down so that we can be alerted to issues and repair them quickly.\n\n## Questions?

It stands for "quiet" and you can use across multiple Docker commands. For example:\n\n      docker ps -q\n\n      z57uyf7022ds\n      f65f7022988d\n      sd38r7f70229\n      csji37022988\n\nThis makes the q flag ideal for composing commands where the IDs of a group of images or containers into another Docker command like so:\n\n**Stop all running Docker containers**\n\n    docker stop $(docker ps -q)\n\n**Tail the logs of all running containers**\n\n    docker logs -f $(docker ps -q)\n\n**Remove all stopped containers**\n\n    docker rmi $(docker ps -aq)\n\n### Use xargs\n\nYou can also use xargs when building multi-step Docker commands:\n\n**Docker stop running containers, if they exist**\n\n    docker ps -q | xargs -r docker stop\n\nBy passing the xargs --no-run-if-empty or -r flag we are stating that the command, in this case Docker stop, should only be executed if the previous pipe generated output, which is to say if there actually are any Docker containers running.\n\n## Space management\n\nOne of the things you\'re likely to come up against when working with Docker is the amount of space that orphaned or unused images, layers and containers take up. Eventually you will get some strange error message during a build that you follow to a realization that your local Docker installation has already chewed through all the disk space that was alloctated for it to use.\n\n**Run containers with the -rm flag**\n\nRunning containers while passing the -rm flag will remove the container once you\'ve exited. This makes it ideal for when you\'re running containers locally in order to test your builds, and will help you keep a handle on the disk space Docker is using.\n\n### Cron job: remove all old containers\n\nYour Dockerized staging hosts will eventually encounter the same problem. I like to create cron jobs that run to regularly prune unused Docker images:\n\nHere\'s a good one that comes from [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/347431091415703552)\n\n    docker ps -a | grep \'weeks ago\' | awk \'{print $1}\' | xargs docker rm\n\nYou can put that in a script and have a cron job run it once a week on your staging host.\n\n### Transfer a Docker image without using a registry\n\nDid you know that you can export a Docker image to a tar file for sharing, whenever you don\'t have the use of a registry for pushing and pulling images?\n\nThe Docker save command takes a Docker image id and can output a tarfile like so:\n\n    docker save a3df > latest.tar\n\n## Utility Scripts\n\n### Docker staging script\n\nSpeaking of using docker save to export tarfiles, here\'s a handy Docker staging script I wrote that only requires a single linux machine. If you are developing your Dockerized app locally on your machine, you can run this script to stage your latest work for you automatically.\n\nThis script assumes that your host is running Docker and that you have ssh configured. Change the STAGING_IP variable to your machine\'s address:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    # This script will build and stage a docker image on a linux box\n\n    echo "This will stage the branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD\n    )"\n\n    stage ()\n    {\n      STAGING_IP=127.0.0.1\n\n      echo "Building docker image. Standby..."\n\n      # grab docker\n      IMAGE_ID=$(docker build . | grep "Successfully built " | cut -d \' \' -f 3)\n\n      TARBALL="$IMAGE_ID.tar"\n\n      echo "Exporting container for transfer, standby..."\n\n      docker save $IMAGE_ID > $TARBALL\n\n      echo "Created tarball of docker image: $TARBALL"\n\n      echo "Transferring Docker image to staging. Please standby..."\n      scp $TARBALL root@docker-staging:/var/stage\n\n      echo "Running Docker image on staging. Please standby..."\n\n      # This runs a command over ssh on your VM to load your Docker image, stop any running Docker images and then run your new image in detached mode\n      ssh docker-staging "cd /var/stage/ && docker load < $TARBALL && docker ps -q | xargs -r docker stop && docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 $IMAGE_ID"\n\n      echo "Cleaning up local tarball..."\n      rm $TARBALL\n\n      echo "Staging complete!"\n      open http://$STAGING_IP\n    }\n\n    while true; do\n        read -p "Do you want to continue?" yn\n        case $yn in\n            [Yy]* ) stage; break;;\n            [Nn]* ) exit;;\n            * ) echo "Yes or no?";;\n        esac\n    done\n\nThis is a handy bash script for including in your project\'s source code, especially if your project has more than one developer working on it.\n\nThis script will:\n\n*   Docker build in the current directory\n*   capture the resulting Docker image ID\n*   Docker save the image to a tarfile\n*   scp the tarfile to your vm\n*   Load the tarfile into your vm\'s Docker daemon\n*   Docker stop whatever images are currently running on your vm\n*   Docker run your new image\n*   Open your staging machine\'s IP address in a browser tab\n\n### Referencing images and containers with shorthand\n\nDid you know that you can often reference a Docker image or container using just the first 3 characters of its ID?\n\n      docker images\n\n      z57uyf7022ds\n\n      docker run -it -p 80:80 z57\n\n### Use Docker prune\n\nAs of Docker 1.13, you can use Docker\'s prune command. Here\'s [a stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32723111/how-to-remove-old-and-unused-docker-images) detailing its usage.\n\nThis would also be a good candidate for a cron job that regularly frees up resources.'},uL8o:function(e,t,n){"use strict";function o(e){n("Ac+A")}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var a=n("Q6FB"),s=n("pJjY"),i=n("XyMi"),r=o,l=n.i(i.a)(a.a,s.a,s.b,!1,r,"data-v-8f159364",null);t.default=l.exports},"uLD/":function(e,t){e.exports="## Project source\n\n[View and clone the project here](https://github.com/zackproser/docker-express-nodeunit)\n\n## Project overview\n\nThis project demonstrates how to set up a Dockerized web service in node.js, using nodeunit tests for coverage, which prevents bad builds from being shipped.\n\nThe project includes a bash script that wraps nodeunit coverage for the web service. If any changes are introduced which cause any one of the nodeunit tests to fail, the Docker build will terminate.\n\nThis makes it easier to prevent bad builds from being shipped to production.\n\n## Try it out\n\n    git clone https://github.com/zackproser/docker-express-nodeunit.git\n    cd docker-express-nodeunit\n    docker build .\n\n## Loading an Express web service in nodeunit\n\nHere’s a trick for running your express based web service in nodeunit tests. You can wrap your app.listen call in a check that determines whether or not the file is being loaded by a calling script (as it will be in the case of nodeunit loading it):\n\n    if (!module.parent) {\n        app.listen(app.get('port'), () => {\n            console.log(`Example project listening on port ${app.get('port')}`)\n        })\n    }\n\n## Running your Express web service locally during testing\n\nWith the above changes in place, we can leverage node’s built-in http module to load our app.js (and its included Express routes) and then run it locally:\n\n    const\n      nodeunit = require('nodeunit')\n      , app = require('../app')\n      , request = require('request')\n      , httpServer = require('http').createServer(app)\n      , testPort = 3333\n      , testUriRoot = `http://localhost:${testPort}`\n\n    /*\n      Run before every individual test\n\n      Loads app.js and its express routes\n      in order to create an http server\n      and listen on the test port\n\n      @param {Function} setupCallback Function to run when processing is complete\n      @return {void}\n     */\n    exports.setUp = (setupCallback) => {\n      httpServer.listen(testPort, setupCallback)\n    }\n\nBy leveraging nodeunit’s setUp functionality, we can ensure that our local test server is available before every individual test is executed.\n\nThis allows us to write nodeunit tests that make requests to our actual web service, the same service that will run in production, which means we can test how functionality like validation will behave:\n\n    //Tests that POSTing to /example without a url param returns an error\n    exports.testBadPostRequestIsRejected = (test) => {\n      let badOptions = {}\n      request({\n        uri: `${testUriRoot}/example`,\n        method: 'POST',\n        json: true\n      }, (err, resp, body) => {\n        test.equals(400, resp.statusCode)\n        test.equals(body.msg, 'You must supply a URL')\n        test.done()\n      })\n    }\n\nThis test will make a request to our web service, passing a bad body that’s missing a required parameter.\n\nJust as we defined a setUp function, we define a tearDown function that will run after every individual test. This ensures that our local test service will be closed down cleanly following testing:\n\n    /**\n     * Runs after every individual test\n     *\n     * Shuts down the local HTTP server\n     *\n     * @param  {Function} tearDownCallback Function to run when processing is complete\n     * @return {void}\n     */\n    exports.tearDown = (tearDownCallback) => {\n      httpServer.close(tearDownCallback)\n    }\n\n## Hooking nodeunit test run status into Docker\n\nNow that we have a test setup that covers our web service, how do we ensure that only good builds are created?\n\nDocker will exit in the middle of a build if any of the commands (or scripts that those commands reference) exit with a non-zero status, signifying an error.\n\nTo this end, we next create a script, [runTests.sh](http://runTests.sh), which wraps our nodeunit test suite:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    ###############################################\n    # Runs nodeunit tests - and breaks bad builds\n    #\n    # Captures exit code of nodeunit tests and exits\n    # with it.\n    #\n    # Docker will see a non-zero exit status as a failure,\n    # preventing the Docker build from completing\n    #\n\n    echo \"Running nodeunit tests...\"\n\n    nodeunit tests/example-tests.js > testsOutput\n\n    # Inspect the exit code of the last command\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n      echo \"All tests passed!\"\n      # This will exit cleanly\n      exit 0\n    else\n      echo \"ERROR: Not all tests passed! This build will terminate until code is fixed!\"\n      # This will break the Docker build\n      exit 1\n    fi\n\n    # Read the output of the tests to STDOUT\n    # so they'll be visible during a Docker build\n    cat testsOutput && rm testsOutput\n\nOur script inspects the outcome our nodeunit test run using $?, which in bash references the exit code of the last executed command.\n\nWith this in place, we can add this script to our Dockerfile. During a build, we’ll add this script to the container, chmod it so that it’s executable, and run it.\n\nIf it exits with a 0 status, meaning that every one of our nodeunit tests passed, Docker will continue building our image. If even a single nodeunit test fails, Docker will see our script exiting with an error, and stop building the bad container until someone can debug and fix the underlying issue in the web service codebase.\n\nHere’s what our Dockerfile looks like:\n\n    FROM node:boron\n\n    LABEL maintainer=\"zackproser@gmail.com\"\n\n    # Set the workdir, the directory in the resulting container\n    # to which all following paths in this Dockerfile will be relative\n    WORKDIR /app/\n\n    COPY public public/\n\n    COPY routes routes/\n\n    COPY views views/\n\n    COPY tests tests/\n\n    ADD app.js package.json runTests.sh /app/\n\n    # Prevents excessive npm logging to STDOUT (only errors will be echoed)\n    ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL error\n\n    # Install all node modules; also install nodeunit globally so it can be called in our runTests.sh bash script\n    RUN npm i && npm i -g nodeunit\n\n    # Modify script so it can be run\n    RUN chmod +x runTests.sh\n\n    # Run the tests script, which in turn calls nodeunit\n    # And exits with the exit status of nodeunit\n    # Docker will error out if it sees a non-zero exit status from any command\n    # Therefore, the failure of a single nodeunit test (caused by bad code or project changes)\n    # will result in the Docker build breaking (so you can't ship it)\n    RUN /app/runTests.sh\n\n    ENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]"},vIQC:function(e,t){e.exports="[![zack-proser-canyonrunner](/static/assets/img/canyonrunner.png)](https://objective-newton-10ea2c.netlify.com/)\n\n## I Open Sourced My Game\n\nBuilding CanyonRunner was a tremendous amount of fun, thanks largely to Richard Davey's excellent [Phaser framework](http://phaser.io/).

[Open sourcing my game (check out the repo here)](https://github.com/zackproser/CanyonRunner)\n2.  Offering code samples and explaining some of the features I implemented\n\nI built this game from start to finish in 76 days. In the course of developing it, one of the running themes I noticed on the Phaser forums was that most developers were tackling their first game and were unsure about how to implement common game features like saved games, multiple levels, different experiences for mobile and desktop, etc.\n\nPhaser is well organized and documented, so while its various API's and systems were easy to get started with, it was less clear to many developers how to fit everything together into a coherent gaming experience. [I open sourced CanyonRunner](https://www.github.com/zackproser/canyonrunner) and decided to do an in-depth post about its various features in order to create a resource for other developers that might be in the middle of developing their own HTML5 game.\n\nHopefully some of the features I built into CanyonRunner, such as player-specific saved games, multiple levels each with their own atmosphere and game mechanics, different experiences optimized for desktop / mobile, and alternate endings determined by player performance, will resonate with and assist other game developers.\n\nTo get a sense of CanyonRunner, or to play it through in its entirety (which will take you less than 10 minutes if you make zero mistakes), [click here to play!](https://objective-newton-10ea2c.netlify.com/)\n\n## Screenshots\n\nHere's a look at some screenshots from the actual game.

placing under source control. If your game project is generating logs, debug output, or uses node_modules, you can save space in your repository by specifying these files and directories in your .gitignore file.\n\n**Gruntfile.js:** I used the command line task-runner [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) in order to automate some of tedious and repetitive development tasks. Grunt will be familiar to many web developers, but for those of you who have not encountered it before, Grunt allows you to define tasks, namely those that you find yourself repeatedly having to perform while developing, and bundle them together into a single or a few commands.\n\nAs an example, if you are working with scss, you may constantly find yourself performing the same mundane tasks as you build out your project, such as concatenting 4 different scss files together, then compiling them to raw css, then minifying that resulting css file and moving it into a specific folder where it can be served.\n\nInstead of doing this manually each time, you can configure a grunt task to do exactly these steps in that order - and all you'd have to do is type \"grunt\" on the command line. Better yet, Grunt can \"watch\" certain files or directories for changes and then perform associated actions on its own. You can even set up completely customized tasks to perform, as we'll see in a moment with the Google Closure Compiler for optimizing JavaScript.\n\nGrunt can be painful to set up and configure, and often times it's overkill for a small project, but it can effectively streamline your workflow if you're dealing with multiple source files, concatenation and minification. In CanyonRunner, as in many Phaser projects, I save off each game state as a separate javascript file for sanity while developing, but we only want to serve as few minified javascript files as possible with our finished game. This makes Grunt a logical choice.\n\n**compiler.jar:** This is the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/), which is a tool that makes JavaScript download and run faster. After concatenating all my custom JavaScript into a single file, I run it through the Closure Compiler so that the final output .js file that is served up by the game is as lean and mean as possible. The compile command within the exec task uses the compiler.jar to generate the optimized CanyonRunner.min.js, save it to the correct build directory, and echo a string confirming the task completely successfully:\n\n```\n    module.exports = function(grunt) {\n\n      // Project configuration.\n      grunt.initConfig({\n        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),\n        concat: {\n          options: {\n            separator: ';'\n          },\n          dist: {\n            src: ['src/*.js'],\n            dest: 'build/<%= pkg.name %>.js'\n          }\n        },\n        uglify: {\n          options: {\n            banner: '/*! <%= pkg.name %> <%= grunt.template.today(\"yyyy-mm-dd\") %> Copyright Zack Proser */\\n'\n          },\n          dist: {\n            files: {\n              'build/<%= pkg.name %>.min.js' : ['<%= concat.dist.dest %>']\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        exec: {\n          //Compile Final JS File\n          compile: 'java -jar compiler.jar --js build/CanyonRunner.js --js_output_file build/CanyonRunner.min.js --warning_level QUIET && echo \"Successfully Compiled CanyonRunner Dist Build\"',\n          //Output Clean Distribution Build\n          createDistributionFolder: \"mkdir -p CanyonRunner-distribution/{assets/{audio,backgrounds,sprites},build/custom,css,icons,images}\",\n          //Move assets\n          copyIndex: 'cp index.html ./CanyonRunner-distribution',\n\n          copyFavicon: 'cp ./assets/favicon.png ./CanyonRunner-distribution/assets',\n\n          copyAudio: \"cp ./assets/audio/{audio.ogg,audio.m4a,audio.json} ./CanyonRunner-distribution/assets/audio\",\n\n          copySprites: \"cp ./assets/sprites/{sprites.png,sprites.json} ./CanyonRunner-distribution/assets/sprites\",\n\n          copyBackgrounds: \"cp ./assets/backgrounds/{desert-open.png,level1-background.png,level2-background.png,level3-background.png,sad-desert.png} ./CanyonRunner-distribution/assets/backgrounds\",\n\n          copyPhaser: \"cp ./build/custom/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js ./CanyonRunner-distribution/build/custom\",\n\n          copyCanyonRunner: \"cp ./build/CanyonRunner.min.js ./CanyonRunner-distribution/build\",\n\n          copyCss: \"cp ./css/stylesheet.css ./CanyonRunner-distribution/css\",\n\n          copyIcons: \"cp ./icons/* ./CanyonRunner-distribution/icons\",\n\n          copyImages: \"cp ./images/* ./CanyonRunner-distribution/images\"\n        }\n      });\n\n      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-concat');\n      grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-exec');\n\n      grunt.registerTask('default', ['concat', 'uglify', 'exec']);\n    };\n```\n\nNote that the assets are also moved by Grunt into their correct destinations during the build. Once your Gruntfile is in place and configured correctly, it's much easier to just type \"grunt\" in your terminal and get a perfectly built game as an output than to build one manually. This is doubly true if you're testing something that requires you to make changes and then build, or if you're trying to remember how to build the project after 3 months of not touching it.\n\n#### Creating a Distribution-Ready Build in One Command\n\nThe reason we soldier through the initial tedium of configuring Grunt is that once we have everything set up, we can literally build a distribution-ready copy of our game in a single command:\n\n    $ grunt\n\nIf you've cloned [the CanyonRunner repo](https://github.com/zackproser/CanyonRunner) and are following along, you can cd into the project root and type grunt in your terminal to see what I'm talking about. Grunt will execute the tasks configured in your Gruntfile to concatenate all the javascript files, run them through the Google Closure Compiler, copy all the assets correctly and put everything where it belongs: into a single new directory called CanyonRunner-distribution which will appear in the project root.\n\nThis distribution directory can now be named whatever you want and handed off to a customer or game hosting site for distribution. Having this build infrastructure in place will save you dozens of hours over the course of a project.\n\n### Directories at a Glance\n\nNow, let's consider the purpose of each directory.\n\n#### assets\n\nThis directory holds the audio files, background images, and spritesheets used by our game.\n\n#### build\n\nThis directory is home to the files that are required by our game to work, such as the actual Phaser framework files. Our build tool gathers up only what is needed from here when creating a distribution.\n\n#### css\n\nHolds the simple stylesheet required to make the orientation (rotate your phone!) image work properly.\n\n#### icons\n\nHolds the various sized app icons that would be required by, say, an iOS app that was loading your Phaser game in a webview.\n\n#### images\n\nThis directory holds a special image required by Phaser to render the screen telling the user they should rotate their phone to landscape mode in order to play the game. When phaser detects that the user's phone is being held upright, this image is used to render that hint on screen.\n\n#### node_modules\n\nThis is the directory where npm, node's package manager, installs dependencies. When you **require** a module in your node.js script, one of the places node looks for that module is here. In the case of this project, our server.js file (see next section) uses the express module, which would end up here after running the npm install command.\n\n#### src\n\nArguably the most important directory, this holds all of our separate .js files - for each level, menu, interstitial scene, etc. Once we have finished our game and we're ready to make a build, our build tool will look into this directory to gather together all the separate files into one single concatenated and minified javascript file that's fit for distribution with our finished game.\n\n### Running a Local Fileserver to Ease Development with Node.js\n\nWhile developing a Phaser game it is very helpful to have a local fileserver that we can run with a single command. This makes it easy to serve up our index.html file locally, which loads all our Javascript and Phaser files so we can see and play our game as we're building it.\n\nYou could set up a traditional web stack with apache, or use something that handles this for you such as [Mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/). I feel these options are too involved for what we want to do: simply serve up our index.html file locally so we can view it at localhost:8080\\. Our index.html file will in turn load the Phaser library, and then our game itself so we can test changes with low hassle and iterate quickly.\n\n[Follow these instructions to install Node.js on your machine](https://nodejs.org/download/). Once that's done, you can run the server.js file in the project root by typing:\n\n    $ server.js\n\nNow you can play and test your Phaser game by typing localhost:8080 into your browser.\n\nLet's take a look at what this simple utility script looks like:\n\n```\n    var\n        express = require('express'),\n        app = express(),\n        port = 8080\n    ;\n\n    //Set the 'static' directory to the project root - where index.html resides\n    app.use(express.static('./'));\n\n    //When root is requested, send index.html as a response\n    app.get('/', function(req, res){\n        res.send('index.html');\n    });\n\n    //Create the server by listening on the desired port\n    var server = app.listen(port, function() {\n        console.log('Visit localhost:' + port + ' to see your Phaser game');\n    });\n```\n\n**Notice we're requiring the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) module** to abstract away serving static assets. This means you'll need to install express library locally to your project in order for server.js to work. If you don't already have express installed globally on your system, type:\n\n    $ sudo npm i\n\nThis command will pull down all required dependencies from npm, node's package management system.\n\nWith our simple fileserver in place, all we have to do to view changes to our source code or playtest our game is run our server and visit localhost:8080.\n\n### Creating a Preloader\n\nPhaser games use preloaders as special game states to perform setup and configuration tasks that can or must be run before a more interactive game state is loaded.\n\nLet's examine CanyonRunner's preloader state. It has a few important setup tasks to perform. First, it sets up the background for the splashscreen and loads the various levels' background images.\n\nThere's a very handy Phaser convenience feature known as a Preload Sprite that I'm taking advantage of here to render the loading bar that says \"loading\" and expands from 0 to 100% as the splashscreen itself is being prepared. First, you set up the sprite that will be used as the preloadBar. Then you can call the method setPreloadBar and pass in the sprite - Phaser handles all the internal timing and display logic for us.\n\n```\n    CanyonRunner.Preloader = function (game) {\n\n        this.ready = false;\n    };\n\n    CanyonRunner.Preloader.prototype = {\n\n        preload: function () {\n\n            this.background = this.add.sprite(0, 0, 'desert-open');\n            this.splashscreen = this.add.sprite(0, 0, 'sprites', 'canyon-runner-splash');\n\n            this.preloadBar = this.add.sprite(this.game.world.centerX - 127.5, this.game.world.centerY, 'sprites', 'progress');\n                this.load.setPreloadSprite(this.preloadBar);\n\n            this.game.load.image('desert-open', 'assets/backgrounds/desert-open.png');\n            this.game.load.image('sad-desert', 'assets/backgrounds/sad-desert.png');\n            this.game.load.image('dark-forest', 'assets/backgrounds/level3-background.png');\n            this.game.load.image('desert', 'assets/backgrounds/level1-background.png');\n            this.game.load.image('desert2', 'assets/backgrounds/level2-background.png');\n\n            //AudioSprites\n            if (this.game.device.firefox || this.game.device.chrome || this.game.device.chromeOS) {\n\n                this.game.load.audiosprite('sound', 'assets/audio/audio.ogg', 'assets/audio/audio.json');\n\n            } else {\n\n                this.game.load.audiosprite(\"sound\", 'assets/audio/audio.m4a', 'assets/audio/audio.json');\n            }\n        },\n\n        create: function () {\n\n            this.preloadBar.cropEnabled = false;\n\n        },\n\n        update: function () {\n\n            if (this.cache.isSoundDecoded('sound') && this.ready == false)\n            {\n                this.state.start('MainMenu');\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    };\n```\n\n#### Optimizing Asset Delivery with Audiosprites\n\nAnother important task that falls to the preloader is to determine which type of audiosprite should be loaded. An audiosprite is a single file that contains all the sound effects and songs required by the game mashed together, to save space and bandwidth during asset delivery. Tools that create audiosprites also export a map file, usually in json or xml, that explicitly states the time slices of the audiosprite wherein each individual sound and song starts and ends. Let's take a look:\n```\n    {\n       \"resources\":[\n          \"audio.ogg\",\n          \"audio.m4a\",\n          \"audio.mp3\",\n          \"audio.ac3\"\n       ],\n       \"spritemap\":{\n          \"3rdBallad\":{\n             \"start\":0,\n             \"end\":39.18222222222222,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"AngryMod\":{\n             \"start\":41,\n             \"end\":99.79292517006803,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"Ariely\":{\n             \"start\":101,\n             \"end\":132.64009070294784,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"angel\":{\n             \"start\":134,\n             \"end\":140.53786848072562,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"aronara\":{\n             \"start\":142,\n             \"end\":202.12081632653062,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"crash\":{\n             \"start\":204,\n             \"end\":205.94902494331066,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"explosion\":{\n             \"start\":207,\n             \"end\":221.7374149659864,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"heal\":{\n             \"start\":223,\n             \"end\":226.0316553287982,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"launch\":{\n             \"start\":228,\n             \"end\":232.39873015873016,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"missile-lock\":{\n             \"start\":234,\n             \"end\":238.99954648526077,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"missile-reload\":{\n             \"start\":240,\n             \"end\":241.27274376417233,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"negative\":{\n             \"start\":243,\n             \"end\":243.68643990929706,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"rocket-start\":{\n             \"start\":245,\n             \"end\":247.20734693877552,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"sonar-found\":{\n             \"start\":249,\n             \"end\":252.10131519274375,\n             \"loop\":false\n          },\n          \"sonar\":{\n             \"start\":254,\n             \"end\":260.26213151927436,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"success\":{\n             \"start\":262,\n             \"end\":308.4660317460317,\n             \"loop\":true\n          },\n          \"swoosh\":{\n             \"start\":310,\n             \"end\":311.2408163265306,\n             \"loop\":false\n          }\n       }\n    }\n```\nThis mapping file allows frameworks like Phaser to efficiently deliver a single audio file, while still allowing the game developer the convenience of referring to individual sounds and songs by their key names while programming.\n\nAfter developing CanyonRunner by using separate audio files for each sound, I used a free tool to create one single audiosprite for each supported filetype (different browsers support different audiosprite filetypes). That's why the preloader uses Phaser's device helper methods to determine which browser the player is using. Firefox and Chrome support .ogg files, while Safari supports .m4a. You can convert your final audiosprite to both formats and include it in your assets directory. With your preloader determining the proper format based on your user's browser, each player will get a single optimized audiosprite that will run perfectly for them.\n\n### Creating a SplashScreen\n\nSuccessfully building a complete game requires attention to lots of small details which, taken together, build up a feeling of a polished and finished product.\n\nOne of the first contact points our players will have with our game is the splashscreen. A good splashscreen can set up the feel and mood of the game, begin introducing the themes that will run throughout, and get the player excited about playing. Let's take a look at how we can create a splashscreen for our Phaser HTML5 game.\n\nHere is the full MainMenu.js file for CanyonRunner, which sets up the intro splashscreen and waits for the player to click the Start button:\n```javascript\n    CanyonRunner.MainMenu = function(game) {\n\n    };\n\n    CanyonRunner.MainMenu.prototype = {\n\n        create: function() {\n            this.sound = this.game.add.audioSprite('sound');\n\n            //Check if Returning Player & If Has Level Progress Saved\n            this.playerStats;\n            if (localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats') != null) {\n                this.playerStats = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats'));\n            } else {\n                this.playerStats = {\n                    topScore: 0,\n                    topTime: 0,\n                    returnPlayerToState: 'HowToPlay'\n                };\n            }\n            //Load Main Menu\n            this.background = this.game.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 1200, 600, 'desert-open');\n            this.background.fixedToCamera = true;\n            this.splashscreen = this.add.sprite(0, 0, 'sprites', 'canyon-runner-splash');\n\n            this.sound.play('aronara');\n\n            this.soundButton = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX + 335, this.game.world.centerY - 285, 'sprites', this.toggleMute, this, 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon');\n            this.soundButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n            if (!this.game.sound.mute) {\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n            } else {\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n            }\n            //Read Player Stats & Display\n            if (this.playerStats.topScore > 0 && this.playerStats.topTime > 0) {\n                this.playerStatTextStyle = {\n                    font: \"30px Helvetica\",\n                    fill: \"#fff\",\n                    stroke: \"#000\",\n                    strokeThickness: 5,\n                    align: \"center\"\n                };\n                this.playerStatString = \"YOUR TOP SCORE: \" + this.playerStats.topScore + \" & YOUR TOP TIME: \" + Math.round(this.playerStats.topTime);\n                this.playerStatText = this.game.add.text(this.game.world.centerX - 350, this.game.world.centerY - 275, this.playerStatString, this.playerStatTextStyle);\n            }\n\n            //Create Intro Player\n            this.player = this.game.add.sprite(64, 64, 'sprites', 'rocket-sprite');\n            this.player.y = 320;\n            this.game.physics.enable(this.player, Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n            this.player.body.bounce.y = 0.2;\n            this.player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;\n            this.player.body.setSize(64, 34, 0, 15);\n\n            //Set up Initial Events\n            this.game.time.events.add(300, this.introFlyingScene, this);\n\n            this.startbutton = this.add.button(350, 500, 'sprites', this.startGame, this, 'start-button', 'start-button', 'start-button');\n        },\n\n        update: function() {\n            //Scroll Background\n            if (!this.jetFired) {\n                //Scroll background for flying appearance\n                this.background.tilePosition.x -= 2;\n            } else {\n                this.background.tilePosition.x -= 10;\n            }\n\n            //Start Afterburners\n            if (this.burnEngines) {\n                this.emitter.emitX = this.player.x - 25;\n                this.emitter.emitY = this.player.y + 30;\n            }\n        },\n        toggleMute: function() {\n            if (!this.mute) {\n                this.game.sound.mute = true;\n                this.mute = true;\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n            } else {\n                this.game.sound.mute = false;\n                this.mute = false;\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n\n            }\n        },\n        introFlyingScene: function() {\n\n            //Fly Rocket to Center Screen\n            this.introTween = this.game.add.tween(this.player);\n            this.introTween.to({\n                x: 420\n            }, 2000);\n            this.introTween.start();\n\n            //Fly the ship into view and do a barrel roll\n            this.introFlyingTimer = this.game.time.create(this.game);\n            this.introFlyingTimer.add(1100, function() {\n                //this.doABarrelRoll();\n                this.hoverShipAnimation();\n            }, this);\n            this.introFlyingTimer.start();\n\n            //Turn on Afterburners\n            this.engineBurnTimer = this.game.time.create(this.game);\n            this.engineBurnTimer.add(2000, function() {\n                this.startEngines();\n                this.jetFired = true;\n            }, this);\n            this.engineBurnTimer.start();\n            this.initialPauseTimer = this.game.time.create(this.game);\n            //Pause the Player\n            this.initialPauseTimer.add(2500, function() {\n                this.hoverShip = false;\n            }, this);\n            this.initialPauseTimer.start();\n        },\n\n        hoverShipAnimation: function() {\n            //Temporarily pause ship above text\n            this.hoverShip = true;\n            this.hoverShipTimer = this.game.time.create(this.game);\n            this.hoverShipTimer.add(2000, function() {\n                this.hoverShip = false;\n                this.player.angle = 0;\n            }, this);\n            this.hoverShipTimer.start();\n        },\n\n        startEngines: function() {\n\n            //Create Particle Jet Engine Burn\n            this.emitter = this.game.add.emitter(this.game.world.centerX, this.game.world.centerY, 400);\n            this.emitter.makeParticles('sprites', ['fire1', 'fire2', 'fire3', 'smoke-puff']);\n            this.emitter.gravity = 200;\n            this.emitter.setAlpha(1, 0, 2000);\n            this.emitter.setScale(0.4, 0, 0.4, 0, 2000);\n            this.emitter.start(false, 3000, 3);\n            this.burnEngines = true;\n            this.sound.play('rocket-start');\n        },\n\n        startGame: function(pointer) {\n\n            this.sound.stop('aronara');\n\n            //Load Proper State for Player\n            this.state.start(this.playerStats.returnPlayerToState);\n        }\n\n    };\n```\nFrom reading through the source code you can see that the MainMenu.js file does a few key things:\n\n*   Checks if the current player has saved game data, and renders it\n*   Creates the background, starts scrolling the screen, adds the rocket\n*   Plays the intro music\n*   Runs an initial \"flying scene\" with afterburners and a subtle speed-up\n*   Sets up a startGame function, bound to the start button\n\nA good splashscreen could be as simple as a static background image with a start button. The main goal is to provide an introduction to the game. Notice I've created a mute button on the intro scene - but not a pause button. It's a good idea to give your player the option to mute the game early on in case they're playing in a situation where they don't want sound output. However, on this particular screen a pause button is irrelevant, since the intro scene will loop forever until the user taps or clicks Start.\n\n### Creating and Linking Separate Levels\n\nAt a high level, the process of creating and linking together separate levels involves writing a separate .js file representing each level and placing it in the src/ directory. I'd strongly suggest naming each file after the scene or level it renders. This way you can always quickly and easily find the file you need to edit when you want to make a change to a particular level. Once we're code complete on our game, our build tool will gather up all these separate .js files and concatenate them into a single file that represents our Phaser game.\n\n#### Making Levels Unique with New Game Mechanics\n\nIn the case of CanyonRunner, I looked at each level as an opportunity to explore a new game mechanic. Level 1 is the most straightfoward level and the easiest level to complete. This is because I'm conscientiously using it to introduce players to the first main game mechanic that will be carried throughout the game: avoiding craggy and somewhat randomized spires.\n\nWhile Level 1 is not the most exciting or challenging level, it is a necessary introduction to a few key facts that a successful player of CanyonRunner must understand:\n\n*   Spires are coming at you constantly, in varying and sometimes unpredictable positions\n*   Smashing into a spire causes you damage\n*   Your rocket can take up to 3 hits before exploding\n*   You can \"heal\" your rocket by catching medkits (yes, medkits - it's a cartoony game)\n*   When backed into a corner, you can blast spires with your missiles\n*   Your missiles are unlimited, but take a long time to reload, so you have to fire carefully\n\nWhen you break out the key lessons like this, it becomes clear that there's actually a good deal going on in the first level. Meanwhile, these are concepts that are true for every subsequent level in CanyonRunner, so it's important to get clear on them upfront.\n\nLevel 2 is my personal favorite and it introduces a completely new game mechanic: dogfights. In level 2, you are hounded by a series of bandits armed with missiles as powerful as your own. Taking a hit from one of these enemy missiles means instant death and restarting the level. There's an entire mini-game to figuring out how the bandits behave and track you, and what you have to do in order to actually hit them with a missile.\n\nAt the same time you're dodging enemy missiles and trying to shoot down bandits, those spires and healthkits are still coming at you in somewhat randomized fashion. Thus, the gameplay here is compounding and builds upon previous mechanics. At times, you may be forced by an enemy missile to take a direct hit from a spire, since you know your rocket can withstand up to three of those, but will be instantly destroyed by an enemy missile.\n\nLevel 3 likewise introduces its own unique mechanic: a vicious meteor storm. While continuing to dodge spires and collect healthkits that are coming at you horizontally, you must also successfully dodge somewhat randomized and potentially very fast meteoroids that are raining down on you vertically. As is true with the spires, your rocket can survive up to three direct hits from a meteoroid. The now two planes of deadly obstacles compound on one another to create the most movement-intensive level in CanyonRunner.\n\nIncrementally introducing new game mechanics in this manner is a good way to increasingly challenge your players as your game progresses, while still making the gameplay feel logical and sensible. Throwing all of these mechanics at the player from the get-go could result in the game feeling overly complex and runs the risk of alienating and overwhelming the player, who is then unlikely to return. It's far better to allow the player to make some degree of progress while learning the core mechanics before throwing your biggest challenges at them.\n\n#### Handling Transitions Between Levels\n\nLet's take a quick look at how level1.js handles the next 3 possible states following play:\n\n*   The user succeeds - and should be passed to the next scene\n*   The user fails - and should be passed to the main menu after we preserve their game data\n*   The user quits - and should be passed directly to the main menu\n\nHere are the functions at the end of level1.js that handle these transitions. While the crux of switching states is calling Phaser's state.start method, you'll usually want to perform certain tear-down or data persistance tasks before making the switch:\n```\n    handleUserDataGameLoss: function() {\n            //Handle Player Scores and Times\n            this.interval = 0;\n            this.step = this.playerStats.topScore - this.interval;\n            if (this.score > this.step) {\n                this.playerStats.topScore = this.interval + this.score;\n            }\n            this.playerStats.topTime = this.playerStats.topTime + this.survivalTimer.seconds;\n\n            localStorage.setItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats', JSON.stringify(this.playerStats));\n            //Reset Game After Pause\n            this.resetTimer = this.game.time.create(this.game);\n            this.resetTimer.add(4000, function(){\n                this.explosion.kill();\n                this.game.state.start('MainMenu');\n            }, this);\n            this.resetTimer.start();\n        },\n    handleUserDataLevelComplete: function() {\n        //Handle Player Scores and Times\n        this.playerStats.topScore = 50;\n        this.playerStats.topTime = this.playerStats.topTime + this.survivalTimer.seconds;\n        //Set Highest Level Completed by Player\n        this.playerStats.returnPlayerToState = 'NavigationBandit';\n\n        localStorage.setItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats', JSON.stringify(this.playerStats));\n\n        this.buttonAdvance = this.game.add.button(350, 500, 'sprites', this.nextLevel, this, 'advance-button', 'advance-button', 'advance-button');\n        this.buttonAdvance.fixedToCamera = true;\n    },\n    nextLevel: function() {\n        this.sound.stop('success');\n        this.state.start('NavigationBandit');\n    },\n    quitGame: function (pointer) {\n        this.state.start('MainMenu');\n    }\n```s\nIn the case of the player failing or succeeding on the given level, their latest score, their furthest position in the game (as stored in the returnPlayerToState attribute) and their current in-game time are stored via the game's save system before the player is advanced to the next state. See the next section for a complete treatment of a Local Storage based game-save system.\n\n### Creating a Game Save System\n\nHTML5 features a robust storage system known as [Local Storage.](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage) Local storage offers an attractive means of persisting user data for HTML5 game developers. It is widely supported across many different browser and devices and offers a simple interface for storing and retrieving custom objects.\n\nIn the case of CanyonRunner, I store a few key things on the user's system so that I can persist their game progress in case they complete only one or two levels in one session and return later. I call this object playerStats - it's a json object with 3 attributes:\n\n*   The user's Top Score (represented by the number of spires they've avoided)\n*   The user's current time-in-game represented by the number of seconds they've survived\n*   The name of the game state that the user should be returned to (updated as they progress through the game)\n```\n    //////////////////////\n    //READ LOCAL STORAGE\n    //////////////////////\n    this.playerStats;\n    if (localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats') != null) {\n        this.playerStats = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats'));\n    } else {\n        this.playerStats = { topScore: 0, topTime: 0, returnPlayerToState: 'HowToPlay'};\n    }\n```\nThe create function of a given Phaser state is the perfect time to inspect localStorage to see if the player already has an object stored (and to create one if they don't).\n\nInvoking the Local Storage API, I use the localStore.getItem method to check for the special object name I use to set save objects for CanyonRunner. The idea here is similar to namespacing your WordPress plugins - you don't have control over the storage keynames that other developers might write to the user's browser via other games, webapps or websites. To prevent collisions, you should namespace your storage object's name to your game - adding some random numbers decreases the chances of collision.\n\nIn the previous gist above, you can see the logic for updating the player's progress and scores in the handlUserDataLoss and handleUserDataLevelComplete functions.\n\n### Creating Different Experiences for Desktop and Mobile Devices\n\nThis is probably my personal favorite feature of CanyonRunner. Let's say I have CanyonRunner set up and hosted at a particular URL. If you visit this URL with your desktop / laptop browser, you'll get the full desktop version - complete with the keyboard control scheme and the extra fancy (and resource intensive!) particle effects like rocket and missile afterburners and glowing healing mist on healthkits.\n\nHowever, should you happen to hit the same URL with your smartphone, you'll be given the optimized mobile version, with touchpad controls rendered right over the game scene, and no particle effects (to drastically improve mobile performance).\n\nI implemented this feature because I wanted one single instance of the CanyonRunner game to work for all players regardless of what device they were using to play. As the game developer, this also makes my life easier, because once I have the logic and assets in place to handle and serve the two different versions of the game, I don't have to worry about supporting and keeping on parity two actually separate codebases.\n\nThe two main pieces to this feature are the game logic that checks for whether the player is using a desktop or mobile device, and the assets and functions that work together to render the mobile touchpad on screen and bind its buttons to the correct player actions. Let's take a look:\n```\n    CanyonRunner.Level1.prototype = {\n\n            create: function() {\n                    //START MUSIC\n                    ///////////////////\n                    this.sound = this.game.add.audioSprite('sound');\n                    this.sound.play('aronara');\n                    //////////////////\n                    //SET BACKGROUND\n                    //////////////////\n                    this.background = this.game.add.tileSprite(0, -100, 2731, 800, 'desert');\n                    this.background.fixedToCamera = true;\n                    ///////////////////////\n                    //CREATE TOUCH GAMEPAD\n                    ///////////////////////\n                    //Only Mobile Gets Touchpad\n                    if (!this.game.device.desktop) {\n                        this.buttonUp = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 300, this.game.world.centerY + 50, 'sprites', null, this, 'up-arrow', 'up-arrow', 'up-arrow');\n                        this.buttonUp.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.buttonUp.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.up = true;\n                        }, this);\n                        this.buttonUp.onInputUp.add(function() {\n                            this.up = false;\n                        }, this);\n\n                        this.buttonRight = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 200, this.game.world.centerY + 100, 'sprites', null, this, 'right-arrow', 'right-arrow', 'right-arrow');\n                        this.buttonRight.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.buttonRight.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.right = true;\n                        }, this);\n                        this.buttonRight.onInputUp.add(function() {\n                            this.right = false;\n                        }, this);\n\n                        this.buttonDown = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 300, this.game.world.centerY + 150, 'sprites', null, this, 'down-arrow', 'down-arrow', 'down-arrow');\n                        this.buttonDown.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.buttonDown.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.down = true;\n                        }, this);\n                        this.buttonDown.onInputUp.add(function() {\n                            this.down = false;\n                        }, this);\n\n                        this.buttonLeft = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 400, this.game.world.centerY + 100, 'sprites', null, this, 'left-arrow', 'left-arrow', 'left-arrow');\n                        this.buttonLeft.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.buttonLeft.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.left = true;\n                        }, this);\n                        this.buttonLeft.onInputUp.add(function() {\n                            this.left = false;\n                        }, this);\n                    }\n                    //Desktop & Mobile Get Different Firing Buttons\n                    if (this.game.device.desktop) {\n                        this.fireButton = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 60, this.game.world.centerY - 300, 'sprites', null, this, 'fire-missile-button-desktop', 'fire-missile-button-desktop', 'fire-missile-button-desktop');\n                        this.fireButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.fireButton.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.fireMissile();\n                        }, this);\n\n                    } else {\n                        this.fireButton = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX - 350, this.game.world.centerY - 150, 'sprites', null, this, 'fire-missile-button-mobile', 'fire-missile-button-mobile', 'fire-missile-button-mobile');\n                        this.fireButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n                        this.fireButton.onInputDown.add(function() {\n                            this.fireMissile();\n                        }, this);\n                    }\n\n            ...\n```\nYou can see I'm leveraging Phaser's game.device.desktop method to determine which type of device the player is using, allowing me to implement the two control schemes within an if else statement. Notice that when rendering the mobile gamepad, I'm setting each button's fixedToCamera property to true.\n\nGiven that CanyonRunner is a side-scroller, doing this prevents the buttons from sliding off the screen at the start of the level, which would make them considerably less useful to the player.\n\nPhaser's helper device methods that determine which kind of device your players are using make it easy to optimize your game experience for desktop, mobile and tablet form-factors simultaneously.\n\n### Creating Multiple Endings Depending Upon Player Performance\n\nRecent triple A titles as well as classic old school games have explored the concept of multiple endings. Multiple endings increase replay value by allowing players to do multiple playthroughs, following different paths or making different major plot decisions depending on the type of ending they are trying to get.\n\nMultiple endings also allow you to make thematic statements about the kinds of choices, behaviors or chance occurrences that lead to your protagonist achieving either glory or infamy, salvation or condemnation.\n\nI wanted to explore this concept with CanyonRunner, so I implemented a simple multiple ending system. You will get one of two possible endings when you play through CanyonRunner, depending upon how quickly you complete the game. This is one of the reasons that I keep track of the player's \"Top Time\" or total number of seconds since beginning to play through Level 1\\. This concept of time being precious and limited is thematically harmonious with CanyonRunner's story: you are racing desperately needed food and supplies home to your family in a barren post-apocalyptic wasteland. If you take too long doing so, you simply no longer have a family to return to.\n\n#### Gathering Player Performance Metrics to Determine Endings\n\nIf you want to implement multiple endings in your own Phaser game, the underlying logic of how you determine which ending a player unlocks is up to you, but here's a high level overview of how you would organize such a concept in your code:\n\nAs the player progresses through your game, you keep tabs on one or more performance metrics. This could be their total score, how many hostages they rescued, what physical percentage of the world they explored and walked over, how much gold they ended up with, how many innocents they waxed, etc. If you want this to persist between game sessions, you'll want to store this information either via Local Storage, a cookie, or your user database if you have one.\n\nAfter the player has completed the final level, or slain the final boss, or found the final hidden object, at whichever point in your particular game the player is considered to have \"won\", you can have some logic that inspects this player performance information to make a determination about which game state they will proceed to.\n\nMaybe your player collected over 1500 gold throughout the course of playing, and rescued 25 innocents, so they'll receive the \"You are rich and beneficent and live happily ever after\" ending. Maybe they killed every NPC they came across to enrich themselves, so they'll get the \"You're an infamous monster that nobody likes\" ending.\n\nAt this point, actually showing the player the correct ending is simply a matter of calling game.state.start with the right state name for the ending they've earned.\n\n#### Creating the Ending-Determining Game Logic\n\nLet's take a look at how I implemented this in CanyonRunner. Regardless of which ending the player will ultimately unlock, all players will see this interstitial scene after completing the 3rd level. It's the scene that shows the CanyonRunner obtaining a lock on their home beacon and descending to land at home. This makes it a great place to execute the logic that determines which ending to give the player, since this is something that can be done in the background while the player is watching the actual scene on screen. You can see where I'm determining and starting the correct ending within the rocketLanding function:\n```\n    CanyonRunner.EmotionalFulcrum = function(game) {\n\n        this.angelicVoices = null;\n    };\n\n    CanyonRunner.EmotionalFulcrum.prototype = {\n\n        create: function() {\n            this.sound = this.game.add.audioSprite('sound');\n            this.sound.play('sonar');\n\n            //Set Background\n            this.background = this.game.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 1200, 800, 'sad-desert');\n            this.background.fixedToCamera = true;\n            /////////////////////////////\n            //CREATE SOUND TOGGLE BUTTON\n            /////////////////////////////\n            this.soundButton = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX + 240, this.game.world.centerY - 290, 'sprites', this.toggleMute, this, 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon');\n            this.soundButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n            if (!this.game.sound.mute) {\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n            } else {\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n            }\n            //////////////////////\n            //READ LOCAL STORAGE\n            //////////////////////\n            this.playerStats;\n            if (localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats') != null) {\n                this.playerStats = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('Canyon_Runner_9282733_playerStats'));\n            } else {\n                this.playerStats = {\n                    topScore: 0,\n                    topTime: 0,\n                    returnPlayerToState: 'NavigationHome'\n                };\n            }\n            //////////////////\n            //CREATE PLAYER\n            //////////////////\n            this.player = this.game.add.sprite(64, 64, 'sprites', 'rocket-sprite');\n            this.player.y = 120;\n            this.game.physics.enable(this.player, Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n            ///////////////////////////////////\n            //Create Particle Jet Engine Burn\n            ///////////////////////////////////\n            this.emitter = this.game.add.emitter(this.game.world.centerX, this.game.world.centerY, 400);\n            this.emitter.makeParticles('sprites', ['fire1', 'fire2', 'fire3', 'smoke-puff']);\n            this.emitter.gravity = 20;\n            this.emitter.setAlpha(1, 0, 3000);\n            this.emitter.setScale(0.4, 0, 0.4, 0, 5000);\n            this.emitter.start(false, 3000, 5);\n            this.emitter.emitX = this.player.x - 25;\n            this.emitter.emitY = this.player.y + 30;\n            this.burnEngines = true;\n\n            this.descendToLearnTheTruth();\n        },\n\n        update: function() {\n\n            this.emitter.emitX = this.player.x - 25;\n            this.emitter.emitY = this.player.y + 30;\n\n            if (this.landing) {\n                this.landingEmitter.emitX = this.player.x + 27;\n                this.landingEmitter.emitY = this.player.y + 30;\n            }\n\n            //At rest, player should not move\n            this.player.body.velocity.x = 0;\n            this.player.body.velocity.y = 0;\n\n            this.playerSpeed = 250;\n            this.backgroundTileSpeed = 4;\n\n            //Scroll background for flying appearance\n            if (this.slowRocket) {\n                this.background.tilePosition.x -= 4;\n                this.sound.play('sonar-found');\n            } else if (this.stopRocket) {\n                this.background.tilePosition.x = 0;\n                if (Math.floor(this.player.angle == -90)) {\n                    this.stopRocket = false;\n                    this.player.angle = -90;\n                    this.rocketLanding();\n                }\n                this.player.angle -= 2;\n            } else if (!this.landing) {\n                this.background.tilePosition.x -= 10;\n            }\n        },\n        toggleMute: function() {\n            if (!this.mute) {\n                this.game.sound.mute = true;\n                this.mute = true;\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n            } else {\n                this.game.sound.mute = false;\n                this.mute = false;\n                this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n\n            }\n        },\n        descendToLearnTheTruth: function() {\n            this.sound.play('sonar-found');\n            this.homeSignatureLockedTextStyle = {\n                font: \"25px Arial\",\n                fill: \"#09e000\",\n                stroke: \"#000\",\n                strokeThickness: 4,\n                align: \"center\"\n            };\n            this.homeSignatureLockedTextString = \"Home Signature Detected!

It is massively annoying as a player to load up a game while trying to kill some time in a business meeting or to steal a few moments of succor from a family dinner or spousal argument only to have your smartphone erupt in obnoxious, poorly dubbed dubstep that you scramble to mute - only to find there is no mute button. This is exactly the kind of oversight that will drive your players away for good.\n\nLuckily for us, Phaser makes it simple to implement Pause and Mute buttons - so let's go ahead and do that:\n```\n    /////////////////////////////\n    //CREATE SOUND TOGGLE BUTTON\n    /////////////////////////////\n    this.soundButton = this.game.add.button(this.game.world.centerX + 240, this.game.world.centerY - 290, 'sprites', this.toggleMute, this, 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon', 'sound-icon');\n    this.soundButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n    if (!this.game.sound.mute) {\n        this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n    } else {\n        this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n    }\n    //////////////////////\n    //CREATE PAUSE BUTTON\n    //////////////////////\n    this.pauseButton = this.game.add.sprite(this.game.world.centerX + 320, this.game.world.centerY - 280, 'sprites', 'pause-button');\n    this.pauseButton.inputEnabled = true;\n    this.pauseButton.fixedToCamera = true;\n    this.pauseButton.events.onInputUp.add(function() {\n        this.game.paused = true;\n        this.pauseButton.tint = 16711680;\n    }, this);\n    this.game.input.onDown.add(function() {\n        if (this.game.paused) this.game.paused = false;\n        this.pauseButton.tint = 16777215;\n    }, this);\n\n    ...\n\n    toggleMute: function() {\n        if (!this.game.sound.mute) {\n            this.game.sound.mute = true;\n            this.soundButton.tint = 16711680;\n        } else {\n            this.game.sound.mute = false;\n            this.soundButton.tint = 16777215;\n        }\n    },\n```\nAs with our mobile touchpad buttons, it's important to set the fixedToCamera attribute to true on any icon or button we want to remain in place in our side-scroller game.\n\nNotice that I conditionally tint the pause and mute buttons depending upon their status - this is an easy way to make the buttons and the entire game interface feel more responsive, as well as to provide a necessary visual signal to the player about whether or not the game is currently paused or muted.\n\nAs you can see in the code, Phaser is doing all the heavy lifting for us when it comes to actually pausing game execution or muting sound. As developers, we need only flip the boolean property of game.sound.mute or game.paused as makes sense within our interface logic, and the framework handles it from there.\n\n### That's All for Now\n\nI hope this tutorial and examination of some of CanyonRunner's game mechanics and features was helpful to you.
