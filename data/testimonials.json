  "quote": "Zack is very resourceful, entrepreneurial and scrappy. He’ll figure out a way of getting whatever it is done. As well as technical skills, Zack is rounded. He can write and he has broad interests - such as visual arts. Zack has a lot of initiative and will proactively take action when he sees something that needs to be done. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Zack’s work ethic. He never shied away from our demanding hours and would regularly spend the little after-work time he had deepening his technical skills. Lastly, Zack has a great sense of humor and is one of those folks that just makes work more fun. He’s someone you want on your team.",

He always had a collaborative, team player mentality and exceeded expectations on all assigned projects, even those that required a quick turnaround. More importantly, Zack had great communications skills - from proactively providing a project status to any red flags during initial conversations. I would work with Zack again in a heartbeat.",

 "quote": "Take a look at the span of job titles, levels of seniority, and teams reflected in Zack's other recommendations. It's clear Zack brings the same level of near-crazy passion and dedication from his art to every aspect of his professional work. Whether it was cross-team collaboration, picking up a new technology, or complex problem solving, Zack excelled without skipping a beat. From my view, Zack's most impressive, and all-too-rare, trait is deep introspection. Given a problematic shortcoming or knowledge gap, he wields this introspection to quickly diagnose and navigate past situations that would pose as major hurdles to most people. Teapot approved, A+",
